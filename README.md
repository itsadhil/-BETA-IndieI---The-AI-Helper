### Introduction

This project is an AI-powered chatbot application designed to interact with users through a web interface, powered by **React** on the front end and **FastAPI** on the backend. The chatbot leverages various AI and automation capabilities to assist users in performing tasks, fetching information, and even posting content directly to LinkedIn.

At its core, this chatbot is built to provide seamless interactions by understanding user queries and responding intelligently. It is capable of performing tasks such as:

- **Web scraping**: Extracting content from the web based on user queries and returning relevant information.
- **LinkedIn integration**: Allowing users to retrieve LinkedIn profiles and create posts on their LinkedIn account through the chatbot interface.
- **File uploads**: Supporting file attachments (such as images), enabling users to include media in their LinkedIn posts.
- **Real-time communication**: Using WebSockets to ensure smooth, dynamic conversations between the user and the AI without constant page reloads.

The chatbot has been designed to assist in real-world tasks such as content creation, social media management, and automation, while offering a user-friendly interface for interaction. Whether it's searching for web data or drafting professional content for LinkedIn, the chatbot streamlines these actions with a conversational interface.
